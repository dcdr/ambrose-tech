# Cloning The Repository

You will need to clone this repository to complete the exercises. This can be done with a variety of tools. These instructions are for
GitHub Desktop.

to open the main repository page.

repository URL. You may need to use this URL if you are using a GIT tool other than GitHub Desktop. To the right of the URL is an
icon with an arrow pointing downward into a computer monitor. This is the GitHub Desktop download button. Click it.

GitHub Desktop may take a bit of time launch. Log in if you are prompted to do so. Otherwise, you should be prompted to select a
location to download the repository. Select your own storage media (your thumb drive) if you are using a school computer. The click
the clone button to start the download.
